Personally I get a lot of feel-good energy from eating plenty of vegetables, but I do try to also cater to the carnivores of the house. And I will eat small amounts of meat on occasion. I am also a firm believer that if you really eat a ‘mixed diet’ you need to keep it, well, mixed! This means keeping a good balance of foods and involving the fruit/vegetable part at all mealtimes. Your body will thank you later <FaRegSmile /> I have personally found that eating veggies and/or fruit at all mealtimes becomes much easier, once you decide to actually do it. And you do not need to cook things specially for it – this recipe uses leftover pumpkin, for example. 

One manifestation of this food philosophy means upgrading a ham and cheese sandwich with some roast pumpkin. The carnivores are happy to have the meat and the veggievores are happy to have the pumpkin. Something to keep everyone here happy! 

Instructions are as follows:  

Per sandwich: 
1 slice of sourdough bread (I think it works best with a ‘solid’ bread, that can hold the weight of the topping, but feel free to disagree) 
Butter 
1 slice of ham (vegetarian, if you like) 
2 tbsp grated hard cheese, such as emmenthaler or cheddar 
½ tsp mustard (optional) 
Leftover roast pumpkin slices 

Warm the pumpkin gently (in the oven or microwave). Butter the bread, then spread the mustard on if using. Place the slice of ham on top, folding it to fit the bread if needed. Sprinkle the cheese over this. Grill for a few minutes until the cheese has melted. Place some of the warm pumpkin slices on top and serve.
