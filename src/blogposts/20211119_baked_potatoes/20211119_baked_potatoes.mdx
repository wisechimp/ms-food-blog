When the weather outside gets cooler, I love turning to easy comfort foods such as baked potatoes. My preferred method for baking them means you have a relaxed cooking time and an afternoon of anticipation from the lovely smell emanating through the house as they bake! 
It is also one form of ‘fast food’ – the preparation time is minimal; the potatoes then look after themselves in the oven while you do other things. But you do need to remember to throw them in the oven at approximately the right time. I suggest different time and temperature combinations below, to (hopefully) suit your schedule. But I will say this – I think the longer the cooking time, the better. And, the cooking time is not that strict – don’t sweat if they sit in the oven for longer than you planned (it is not unheard of that they end up with an extra half hour here...). 

Per person: 
1 baking potato 
(small) lump of butter 
Salt 
1 piece of foil, large enough to wrap the potato in 

Wash the potatoes. Cut a thin cross on top of each potato, then place in the centre of the piece of foil. Place the lump of butter on top of the potato and grind a little salt on it. Wrap the foil to prevent steam from escaping. Then place on baking tray and pop in the oven. Choose the time and temperature below – but remember: the longer the better <FaRegSmile />

Bake at 140°C for 3 hours  
Bake at 150°C for 2 hours  
Bake at 190°C for 1 hour
