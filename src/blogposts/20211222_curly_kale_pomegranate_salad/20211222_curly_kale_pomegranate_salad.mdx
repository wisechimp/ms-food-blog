100 g Fresh, fine and tender curly kale leaves  
Â¼ whole pomegranate  
1 orange  
30 g walnut pieces  
Olive oil  
Balsamic vinegar  
Salt and peppar  

Tear the curly kale into suitably small bite-sized pieces and place in serving bowl. Separate the pomegranate seeds from the bitter pith and scatter over the curly kale. Peel the orange and cut into slices, then cut into 4-6 pieces, depending on the size of the orange. Scatter over the salad, and finally scatter the walnuts over it. Whisk the oil, vinegar and salt and peppar to make a vinaigrette and pour over the salad shortly before serving.
