Every year in early January, when it is hopefully cold outside, I do our annual freezer stocktake and defrost our large freezer, which is situated in the garage. It is hopefully cold outside, to allow me to keep things there temporarily while I work in the freezer â€“ without them defrosting! 

Having an organised list of items in the freezer has many advantages for us. It allows for a quick check of any (frozen) food items we need to stock up on, or that we absolutely have enough of! It also allows me to plan better for using up certain meals that have been frozen down, be it for lunch or dinner. I certainly find it easier than rummaging around in a cold freezer desperately looking for something that might not even be there! 

But I will say this: I do regret not getting a self-defrosting large freezer. I was not sure when we bought our freezer, but I am now. So, whenever it needs to be replaced, it will be one that does not require me standing with my head in the freezer and my backside sticking out every January as I scrape the ice out of it! 

The stocktake ensures that our freezer list is correct and up to date. And helps me focus on blind sides we have had. Notes from this year include: we currently have enough frozen tomato sauce to make plenty of pizzas through the winter until tomatoes are back in season! It also reminded me we have elderflower cordial, perfect to get out for the boys' birthdays. 

It is quite simple to do your own list. Create a table in either word or excel and at the top you place column heading for date of freezing, item, and portion size. I have a page for different categories, such as bread or vegetables or dinners.  If you would like a copy of my template, feel free to [contact](https://masharphomecooking.com/contact) me!
