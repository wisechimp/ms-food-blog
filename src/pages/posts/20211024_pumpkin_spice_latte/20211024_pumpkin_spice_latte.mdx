The weather really makes me feel we have moved into the cold part of autumn. We now have a cold and bitter wind, making the temperature feel a lot colder than it really is. Yesterday I expected to be okay, since we were due 8°C. In reality the wind made it feel like only 4°C… So pumpkins have been bought and I am mentally ready for cosy indoor activities, and can muster a nice warming pumpkin spice latte. 

As with so much food and drink, I find it is something that always sounds so tempting when visiting a coffee shop. But it is always too sweet for me, so doesn’t quite suit me after all. Just glad I kept the concept, and realised that I could easily make it at home – for me that also means I can have it more frequently, and even make a children’s version (they run around enough without coffee!).  

In the recipe below I have included a suggestion for how much sugar to add, should you want it a little or a lot sweeter than my own preference. But as I write, it is optional. You will simply have to test it to make it suit you. I suggest you taste before pouring into the cups, that way you can always add more sugar, if you think it is needed. 

For our family of 2 adults and 2 children I use: 

3 dl milk  
4 tbsp pumpkin puree*  
¼ tsp mixed spice *or* pumpkin spice *or* ground cinnamon +ginger  
½ tsp vanilla extract (optional)  
1-3 tbsp sugar (optional!)  
2 double espressos  
½-1 dl whipping cream  

Start by heating the milk, pumpkin puree, spice, vanilla extract and sugar (if using!). I heat on a medium setting, 5 min is usually enough, but make sure it is heated through and steaming. While this is heating up I make the espressos.  

Since we have children who would also like some, but (a) they do not drink coffee and (b) they do not like their drinks too hot, I pour some of the heated milk mixture aside into their cups at this stage.  

Finally, with the remaining milk mixture back on the hob, I pour in the coffee and allow it to heat through a little more, thereby also giving the boys' portion a chance to cool a little and I can whip the cream, while keeping the adult version hot.  

Finish off by pouring the hot pumpkin latte into your cups and topping both the adult and children’s version with the whipped cream. 

* pumpkin puree can be bought, or made quite easily by baking a pumpkin (preferably with orange flesh) split in half for 45-60 min at 200°C. Then just scrape out the flesh and mash with a fork. It should be very soft and easy to handle (if not, pop it back into the oven for longer). This can be frozen in suitable portion sizes for later convenience.
