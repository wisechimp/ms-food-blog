I recently baked a bread that needed some stout. I thought it would be fun to see if I could bake something else with the rest of the stout in the bottle. Chocolate and stout is a classic combination, so I thought that would work well. Equally I thought that apple and stout would work well, and it did. What is slightly unusual is that I use a combination of rye and wheat flour, I find it makes a good combination with the stout and chocolate or apple. But if you cannot get / do not have / do not want to use rye flour, you can simply use more of the plain wheat flour instead.  

Makes 25-30 cookies  
75 g plain rye flour  
75 g plain wheat flour  
1 tsp baking powder  
100 g butter, softened   
70 g soft brown sugar  
20 g white sugar  
1 egg  
 
For Chocolate & Stout cookies:  
1 tbsp cocoa powder  
100 g chocolate chips  
75 ml stout  

For Apple, Raisin & Stout cookies:  
1 apple, peeled, cored and finely chopped  
40 g oats  
100 g raisins  
75 ml stout  
 
Mix the flours and baking powders in a bowl or jug and set aside. 
Beat the butter and sugar until fluffy. Add the egg and beat again. Then sift in the flour mix and beat again.  
If making the Chocolate & Stout cookies: sift in the cocoa powder, and add the chocolate chips. Mix, then add the stout and beat it once more.  
If making the Apple, Raisin & Stout cookies: add the apple pieces, oats and raisins. Mix, then add the stout and beat it once more.  

Use two spoons to measure out and shape the cookies – I find that tablespoons give a good size. They do not need to be perfectly round – they are after all home-made cookies, best if people can see that! Place on a baking tray with baking paper on it, leaving a little space between the cookies, so they can spread a little. 
Bake for ca. 17 min. at 170°C. Enjoy!
