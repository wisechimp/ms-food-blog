This is my variant of a smoothie, which is intended to not only give you an energy boost, but also be thirst-quenching, so not too thick. I find this a very pleasant combination! Try having it as part of a lazy weekend breakfast, or to give you an energy boost when you are flagging late afternoon. It is also good after a workout.  

Serves 4 

30 g (50 ml) almonds  
1 small, ripe banana  
1 tbsp pumpkin seeds  
1 tbsp pistachios  
1/8 tsp cinnamon  
250 – 300 ml cold water 

Place the almonds and 100 ml of water in a blender and blend until fairly smooth – about 2-3 min, then add the seeds and pistachios and blend for a further minute, before adding the roughly sliced banana. Blend until a smooth cream (you do not want large bits in your smoothie), then add the cinnamon and the rest of the water, until it has reached a suitable consistency. Serve up fresh and soak up the energy! 

Note 1: You can of course make a larger portion, and save some in the fridge for the next day, but it ends up thicker if you do that. I personally think it is much, much better served fresh! Now, if you do save some, give it a good whisk before serving! 

Note 2: Feel free to blanch the almonds and remove their skins, if you prefer. But it is really not necessary. Personally I do not, since it just takes extra time and I like to think that I get the full nutrional benefit from the almonds by including their skin – they do after all contain fibre and polyphenols! More importantly, I think it tastes good regardless!
