In June lavender becomes abundant in our garden. If you have a warm sunny spot then do plant some in your garden, if you haven’t already! It is happy in the ground or in a pot and is very good for making the bees and the butterflies happy, whom we need! Once planted, lavender needs almost no attention from you, so is very low maintenance. It is also very good, because lavender has edible flower, which you can use to cook fun things like this pudding! Lastly it also has calming properties, which is never a bad thing in our hectic world.

Serves 4 

100 ml white wine  
100 ml water  
100 ml sugar  
Small bunch of fresh lavender (5-10 sprigs)  
1-2 pears (depending on their size and how hungry you are!)  

Place the liquids and sugar in a saucepan, and heat gently. Tie the lavender sprigs together and add to the saucepan, leaving the string hanging out (this is for ease of removal). 
Meanwhile quarter and core the pear(s) but leave the skin on. Halve the quarters lengthwise (so each pear gives you 8 segments). 
When the sugar has dissolved, bring to a gentle boil for 5-10 mins., until it starts to become syrupy. Reduce to a simmer and add the pear. Poach them for 5 mins, then turn them over and poach for a further 5 mins. 
If the pear pieces do not all fit neatly in the liquid you can do this in batches: simply remove the cooked pear to a small bowl, while you cook the remaining pieces. Transfer all the pear back to the syrup when you are done, and allow to cool a little. 

They are perfect with vanilla ice cream, with strawberries, with macaroons – or all of those at the same time! You can serve them (slightly) warm or cold, entirely up to you - and how it fits with your plans. 

Note 1: you could replace the wine with water, if you wish  

Note 2: they will keep for a few days, if kept in the syrup and covered in the fridge.
