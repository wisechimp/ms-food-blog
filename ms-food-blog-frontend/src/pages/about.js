        I work as a scientist at an up-and-coming research centre in Southern
        Sweden. So my days are kept busy doing my part of the installation work
        there! My evenings are spent trying to satisfy the healthy appetites of
        my 2 young boys and my husband. The boys already seem to eat more than
        me! They have also nudged me to experiment more with food, so it will
        satisfy both the adults and the children.
      </p>
      <p>
        For my own part, I’m generally a rather active person, so food for me
        needs to both be satisfying and give me the energy for all my
        activities. Over the years I have realised that this is best achieved by
        maxing out the vegetable part, eating plenty of fish and minimising the
        meat part. In general, I’m not a fan of completely excluding anything,
        but rather trying to find the right balance. I find this more
        sustainable in the long run.

      <p>
        It also gives me great satisfaction to know that this dietary balance is
        more sustainable for our planet too, and as an extra bonus is typically
        more economical. Having had this balance in diet at home for the boys
        from the beginning also means it is quite natural for them to eat this
        way. This has left them more open-minded about foods also in school and
        day-care. I cannot force their choice of foods in school nor later on in
        life, but at least I have given them a good grounding.
      </p>

        The shift from a diet with plenty of meat to one with a majority of veg
        (not that they were ever absent) happened gradually for me, with a lot
        of experimentation. Changing everything at once is too dramatic and too
        hard work to last in the long run. In other words, I encourage you to
        also experiment and to make any shifts to a more healthy and sustainable
        diet a gradual one.

        Here I will blog about my recipes and my ideas for how to approach food
        and time for cooking when also dealing with a busy schedule. I will try
        to show you how you can also make your cooking more sustainable - for
        yourself and for the planet you live on, while being mindful of the time
        you have available (or not!) After all, while cooking might be fun, it
        has to fit with the time YOU have available.
      </p>
      <p>
        In line with my idea of being sustainable, I will also be mindful of not
        wasting food, just because I am trying to also write about it or take
        photographs of it. The food that goes into my creations will be eaten,
        and I will try to not waste additional resources just for the sake of my
        blog.
