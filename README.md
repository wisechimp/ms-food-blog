This is the website for Ma Sharp's Home Cooking, a healthy eating blog.

The currently deployed site is originally based on Gatsby's bare bones hello-world starter and written in javascript. This is currently being migrated to utilise Nextjs in place of Gatsby and typescript is being added for type safety.

Data for building the pages is hosted and sourced from [Sanity's CMS](https://www.sanity.io/).

The site is a functional [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) deployed on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
